<h2> Objective </h2>
<p> The objective of this lab experiment is to compare the spectroscopy readings from two different-colored materials. </p>
<h2> Materials </h2>
<p> -White paper <br> -Green paper <br> -Spectrometer <br> -Computer </p>
<h2> Procedure </h2>
<p> -Gather materials, test functionality of spectrometer<br> -Use computer to create a document for data collection <br> -Use spectrometer to record different wavelengths of EM radiation <br> -Calculate reflectance percentage using formula provided <br> -Convert data into a graph</p>

<h2> Results & Discussion </h2>
<p> The green paper was much less reflective than the white paper (control) within the visual light spectrum but more reflective in the infrared spectrum. There was a surprising amount of red light reflected from the green paper. These results may not be entirely accurate due to measurement errors from the device and natural variations in the ambient light, measuring procedure, and testing materials. </p>
